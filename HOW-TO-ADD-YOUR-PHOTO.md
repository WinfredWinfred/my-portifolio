# How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your profile photo** (the one you uploaded) to the `public` folder with these names:

   ### For Profile Picture:
   - Save as: `public/avatar.jpg`
   - This will appear in the hero section of your portfolio

   ### For Browser Tab Icon (Favicon):
   - Save as: `public/favicon.ico` 
   - OR save as: `public/favicon.png`
   - This will appear in the browser tab

## Detailed Instructions:

### Option 1: Using File Explorer (Easiest)
1. Open the image you uploaded
2. Right-click and select "Save As"
3. Navigate to: `C:\Users\User\Desktop\portifolio\my-portifolio\public\`
4. Save it twice with different names:
   - First time: name it `avatar.jpg`
   - Second time: name it `favicon.ico` (or `favicon.png`)

### Option 2: Copy and Rename
1. Save your image anywhere first
2. Copy it to the `public` folder
3. Rename one copy to `avatar.jpg`
4. Rename another copy to `favicon.ico`

## What Happens After:

Once you save the files:
- ✅ Your photo will appear in the hero section (main page)
- ✅ Your photo will appear as the browser tab icon
- ✅ No code changes needed - it's already configured!

## File Locations:

```
my-portifolio/
└── public/
    ├── avatar.jpg     ← Your profile photo (for website)
    └── favicon.ico    ← Your browser tab icon
```

## Note:
The portfolio is already configured to use these images. Just save them in the right location and refresh your browser!
